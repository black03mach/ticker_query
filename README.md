# Ticker-Query

## Product Description:

Our goal is to provide an easy to use platform for researching an investment opportunity's financial data and news stories. The main differentiator between our product and existing outlets is they are not easy to understand or navigate. Our platform is user friendly for people who are not savvy with complex financial knowledge.

3. Add in easy to understand definitions for financial terms via tootip.

### Phase 2: Necessary

5. Return and display company logo.
